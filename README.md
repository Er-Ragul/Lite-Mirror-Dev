# Lite-Mirror-Suite [Development Server]
Lite-Mirror is a "Remote Desktop" suite which consist of four major things.
  - Lite-Mirror Software (developed using Electronjs)
  - Lite-Mirror Client (web application developed using HTML, CSS & JavaScript)
  - Mouse & Keyboard event controller (like an API between OS & Electron, developed using Python)
  - Lite-Mirror-Suite (A signaling server and it contains electronjs controller functions)
 
 Lite-Mirror is similar to remote deskop applications but it mainly focus on playing "High Graphic Games" through "Chrome, Firefox or Edge Browser".
 This project does not involved any WebGL hence the client web application will be light weight and it will support most the protable devices like Mobile, Laptop & Tablet.
 Currently baisc functionalites were added like Typewriting, Mouse and Touch events.
 
 Test Reports 👍
      Tested on Mobile, Laptop & Desktop from various networks.
      This project is fully based on "Peer to Peer" communication so the server is only required at the time of signaling. 🤝
 
 Currently this project is under development and Gaming functionaliies will be added soon...! 😎
